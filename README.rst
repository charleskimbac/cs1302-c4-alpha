Project Preface
===============

Motivation
++++++++++

This first CSCI 1302 project for |semester| is designed to help you apply and extend your prerequisite Java
programming knowledge with new concepts from CSCI 1302 in a Unix development environment (i.e., |server|).

If you are competent with the learning outcomes for CSCI 1301 (i.e., the prerequisite course), then you
already have most of the Java programming knowledge required to complete this project; otherwise, this
assignment will help you identify the gaps in your prerequisite programming knowledge so that you can tackle
those gaps early in the semester.

This project will also require you to apply some of the new concepts covered in CSCI 1302, including
named packages, exceptions, file input/output (I/O), and Java development in a Unix environment. If you
have actively engaged with the CSCI 1302 course content offered so far this semester, then you should
be able to comfortably, but not necesarilly quicly, complete those aspects of the project by applying
what you have practiced and learned from your content engagement.

Finally, this project may require you to do things that you have never been given explicit directions
or instructions for -- this is just a part of software development. In such cases, you may need need
to do some research to help you plan your solution. That being said, we have intentionally written this
project description document so that it hopefully answers the majority of your questions -- if not, then
please do not hesitate to ask a question on the course Piazza or during office hours.

Academic Honesty
++++++++++++++++

All students at the University of Georgia explicitly agree to abide by the UGA student honor code
when they sign the application for their admission to the University. Additionally, all
students enrolled in a CSCI 1302 course section in |semester| are subject to the
Academic Honesty policy included in the |semester| CSCI 1302 course syllabus. Furthermore, anyone with
access to this project description document is expected to respect the copyright and licensing
terms provided or linked to at the bottom of this document.

With academic honesty in mind, we ask all |semester| CSCI 1302 students not to fork this repository
on GitHub. Doing so may make your copy of the project publicly visible, and that would violate
several of the policies described earlier. Instead of forking the repository, please follow the
instructions provided later in this document to acquire a copy of the project description and
starter code.

Course-Specific Learning Outcomes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you work on and complete this project, then you will gain exposure and practice with
the following learning outcomes:

:LO1.a: Navigate and modify files, directories, and permissions in a multi-user Unix-like environment.
:LO1.b: (Partial) Execute, redirect, pipe, and manage programs/processes in a multi-user Unix-like environment.
:LO1.c: Create and modify text files and source code using a powerful terminal-based text editor such as Emacs or Vi.
:LO1.d: (Partial) Use shell commands to compile new and existing software solutions that are organized into multi-level packages and have external dependencies.
:LO2.b: (Partial) Define, throw, and propagate exceptions appropriately in a software solution.
:LO3.a: Create and update source code that adheres to established style guidelines.
:LO3.b: (Partial) Create class, interface, method, and inline documentation that satisfies a set of requirements.
:LO7.c: (Partial) Use common abstract data types and structures, including lists, queues, arrays, and stacks in solving typical problems.

Project Updates
+++++++++++++++

If your instructor updates the project's requirements or starter code before the project is due,
then this section will be updated to include a summary of those updates and, if needed, 
instructions that describe how to update your working copy of the project with
the latest versions of any changed files.
